As a singer he was a tenor in the Chicago Opera Company.<br>Finally, he left luxury, fame and his native country to become a friar of the Franciscan Order in Peru. In 1952 he published his book of memoirs “Yo pecador”, in which he recounts his worldly life and his conversion. The text inspired the 1959 film in which Mojica appeared with his name within the order.<br>Fray José de Guadalupe Mojica. José Mojica died in Lima in 1974, just six days after his 79th birthday. A legendary life that is treasured in our country as part of its cultural heritage.",

Most of the chairs and furniture are original or donated by wealthy families of Arequipa.",
    "art-gallery-name": "IMMACULATE CONCEPTION ART GALLERY",
    "art-gallery-desc": "The Pinacoteca Inmaculada Concepción was once a small chapel of the convent, but after an earthquake it was used as a dining room prior to its reconstruction.<br>The museum converted it into a art gallery and currently exhibiting the collections of paintings of “The Twelve Apostles” and “The Life of the Virgin Mary”. Along with these the museum also exhibits twentieth century corals, nineteeth century “missals” books, four eighteeth century raincoats, eighteen century chasubles, albs,  and stoles, and a Christmas crib representation that alludes to the First Manager, a tradition that St. Francis of Assisi initiated.<br>At the end of the room we can observe a sculpture of the primary virgin of the Franciscan order, the Virgin of the Immaculate Conception, This sculpture was one of the first in the church and is approximately 300 years old.",
    "choir-name": "ST. FRANCIS SOLANO CHOIR",
    "choir-desc": "The choir is named after the Franciscan saint, San Francisco Solano, a missionary who preached with music using a rabel, a stringed instrument similar to a violin and a lute.<br>Used since colonial times, tThe choir was a special place where the franciscans of St. Francis Convent recited the “Psalter of the Roman Breviary” and had mental prayer. It is called “Religious Choir”, because here the franciscans performed their religious obligations of sanctification every day of the year.<br>Due to the earthquakes some time later, the franciscans no longer used it. It is adorned with wooden chairs from the 18th century, an 18th century pipe organ made by Innocente Foglia and brought from Lima, a rotating lectern where the large corals that the choir read and sang were placed, and corals made of sheepskin and cowhide cover. From the choir you have a unique view of the church and its main altar made of wood. If you wish, you can enter the tower where you can see the bells and enjoy a spectacular view of Arequipa.",
    "architecture-name": "THE ST. FRANCIS CONVENT AND THE CLOISTER ARCHITECTURE",
    "architecture-desc": "The St. Francis of Assisi Convent has existed for more than 400 years. The church has a neoclassical mestizo style with Mudejar ornamentation via the use of ashlar stones with the brick. In the beginning the church only had the central nave, but years later it was expanded and the side aisles were constructed. Unlike the St. Francis of Assisi Convent in Lima, this has no catacombs, because the cemetery was outside.<br>The cloister originally had high ceilings with wooden railings and a calamine roof, but an earthquake destroyed the roof, leaving a non-existent second floor to this day. The cloister has four passageways with decerative ashlar arch columns. In the museum front entrance arch we can see a bell, formerly used to call the Franciscan fathers.<br>In the middle of the convent we admire a basin with a sculpture of St. Francis of Assisi. Surrounding the cloister in the corners we have sculptures made in stone, originally for the temple of Cusco. Among the sculptures we can appreciate a lion and a crocodile, the puma-like she-wolf from the story of Romulus and Remus with her cubs, a puma with a foot in its mouth and a snake, the wolf of Gubbio and St. Francis of Assisi."
